A primitve roguelike game

WASD - movement

Space - attack

* You can heal half of your HP with a potion.
* The sword gives a slight boost to the hero damage.
* Potions, swords and enemies spawn from time to time.
* Let the enemies close the distance themselves, this way you won't have to get damage from engaging
* You can run away from an enemy, although you might still get hit
* Pick up swords to increase your chances of evading an attack (when engaging or running away)
